# Code Quality Guidelines

## Testing Requirements

### Test Thoroughly

- **Verify changes work**: Test all functionality before submitting
- **Cover edge cases**: Test error scenarios and edge conditions
- **Manual testing**: For UI changes, test all demonstrated functionality
- **Automated tests**: Add unit/integration tests for new features
- **Build and test**: Ensure changes don't break the build

## Review Process

### Be Responsive

- **Address review comments promptly**: Respond within a few hours
- **Explain decisions**: Provide context for design choices
- **Iterate**: Be open to feedback and suggestions
- **Keep it concise**: Make it easy for reviewers to understand changes

### Review Your Own Code First

Before asking for help from colleagues, spend some time looking over your code:

- Hunt for possible mistakes
- Identify things that don't quite make sense
- Find spots where the code can be made even better
- This step helps catch issues on your own and shows your teammates that you're committed to producing top-notch code

### Avoid Self-Approval

To ensure the objectivity and thorough evaluation of code changes, developers must avoid self-approvals. Many experienced developers are guilty of this, but it can lead to biases and other unnoticed issues.

## Code Quality Standards

### Follow Style Guides

- **Adhere to project-specific coding standards**: Follow established conventions
- **Write clean code**: Use consistent naming, structure, and comments
- **Automate checks**: Use linting tools where available
- **Documentation**: Update docs when adding new features
- **Format code properly**: Ensure consistent formatting and readability

### Code Dependencies

- **Verify changes don't introduce conflicts**: Check for conflicting dependencies
- **Isolate changes**: Prevent integration challenges
- **Test integration**: Ensure changes work with existing codebase
- **Update lock files**: Keep dependency files in sync

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

### Formatting

Pay close attention to code formatting. Consistent and readable code ensures an improved review process. Use tools or plugins to automate formatting wherever possible.

### Build and Test

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that changes do not break the build and pass all the tests successfully. You can catch these issues with the help of integration tools.

### Performance Considerations

- **Optimize for performance**: Consider the impact of your changes
- **Profile when necessary**: Use profiling tools for performance-critical code
- **Test with realistic data**: Use production-like data for testing
- **Monitor resource usage**: Check memory and CPU usage

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review Checklist

### Pre-Submission Checklist

- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] All functionality tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Build passes locally
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] No breaking changes (or properly documented)

## Best Practices

### Error Handling

- **Implement proper error boundaries**: Use React error boundaries for UI components
- **Handle async operations gracefully**: Provide fallbacks for failed requests
- **Use TypeScript for compile-time error prevention**: Leverage type checking
- **Provide meaningful error messages**: Help users understand what went wrong

### Performance

- **Use React.memo for expensive components**: Optimize re-renders
- **Implement proper loading states**: Provide feedback during async operations
- **Optimize bundle size**: Use dynamic imports and code splitting
- **Use proper caching strategies**: Implement efficient data caching

### Accessibility

- **Use semantic HTML elements**: Ensure proper document structure
- **Include proper ARIA attributes**: Enhance screen reader support
- **Ensure keyboard navigation**: Test all interactions with keyboard
- **Test with screen readers**: Verify accessibility with assistive technologies
